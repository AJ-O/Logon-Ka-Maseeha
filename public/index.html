      <div class="Q">Q. What are you?</div>
      <div>
        We are a website that aims to help people donate various items to
        various charities very easily.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="Q">Q. How do you work?</div>
      <div>
        First, a user signs up, or logs in with us, and then they fill out a
        form specifiying what item you want to donate, and a few photos of the
        item. We then match this request with the NGOs that deal with that
        specific item category, and then inform them. If they choose to accept,
        then we'll directly put you both in touch. That's all!
      </div>
      <br />

      <div class="Q">Q. Sounds great! How do I sign up?</div>
      <div>
        Well, if you are looking to donate items, all you need to do, is
        <a href="#"> click here</a> to sign up with us.
      </div>
      <br />

      <div class="Q">
        Q. What if I'm representing an NGO. How do I register?
      </div>
      <div>
        This is a slightly longer process. First, you'll need to e-mail us at
        "logonkamaseeha@gmail.com" (without the quotes) with the details of your
        NGO (like your name, your area of operations, etc). Then we'll verify
        those details, and give you a custom login portal.
